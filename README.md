# Academic Projects:

- [H & M Product Recommendation](https://github.com/KajariBhaumik/HnM_Product_Recommendation):

H&M group is a well known family of brands and businesses that has over 4,800 retail stores and caters to 53 online markets. It organized a kaggle competition and invited participants to develop product recommendations based on data leveraging over 31 million transaction data involving over 1.3 million unique customers and more than 100,000 products. 

As part of the solution, a market basket analysis was conducted using [RFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFM_(market_research)) scores. Next, this analysis helped identify homogenous groups of customers using K-means clustering. Finally, product recommendations were generated by implementing cosine similarity and collaborative filtering algorithms.
